## General

Simple app to show collection of peoples' kits.

### [Demo](https://mokkelgjerd.no/drakter)

## Setup

This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Get started locally by running `npm i` follwed by `npm start`.

Local `.env` file needs an entry like `REACT_APP_DOC_ID=XXX`, where value points to document ID in [https://jsoneditoronline.org/](https://jsoneditoronline.org/), which currently serves as a very simple API.

## Potential Future Work

- Sort kits by date added
- Use Redux or React Context to avoid sending data and functions everywhere as props
- Styling/UX
- Implement a more sophisticated API, with authentication, etc.
